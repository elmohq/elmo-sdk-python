Each is a sequence of callables, which the awaited client also waits for. `request` reads the request after the credentials are on it and before it is sent. `response` and `error` each return what the caller reads, so a hook that only observes returns what it was given.

            max_retries: The maximum number of times a failed call is sent again. The same count as `retry["max_retries"]`, which wins where both are set. It counts retries and nothing else: `retry` decides which failures are retried. Defaults to `2`.
            retry: How a failed call is retried, or `False` to send it once. Defaults to `{"max_retries": 2}`.

            interceptors: Run your own hooks around every call. Each is a sequence of callables, which the awaited client also waits for. `request` reads the request after the credentials are on it and before it is sent. `response` and `error` each return what the caller reads, so a hook that only observes returns what it was given.
            log_level: Set the log level. Raise it to see what each call sent and what came back. `'debug'` adds headers, with credentials hidden. Read from the `ELMO_LOG` environment variable when unset. Defaults to `'off'`.
            logger: Set the logger. This SDK's own `logging.Logger` by default, which writes to standard error unless the application has given it a handler of its own.
            max_retries: The maximum number of times a failed call is sent again. The same count as `retry["max_retries"]`, which wins where both are set. It counts retries and nothing else: `retry` decides which failures are retried. Defaults to `2`.
            retry: How a failed call is retried, or `False` to send it once. Defaults to `{"max_retries": 2}`.
            timeout: The maximum time one attempt may run. Set `False` or `0` for no limit, or a function that returns the limit of one call. It is given the operation as `METHOD /path` and the limit the call would otherwise get. Defaults to `60`. The unit is seconds.
